# Employee-Management-System
A Employee Management System implemented using C++

This is a basic Employee Management System that will run on the terminal. It has the functionality to add employee details, view them individually with the help of a unique identifier in this case EmpID or view them as a list.
One can also remove an entry permanently from the EMS.

Shortfalls :
The program doesn't have the capability to read existing details stored in the "data.txt" file fed to the EMS in previous sessions. One can add that functionality to make this EMS more robust.
